// IMPLEMENT BUFFER CLASS

1. STORE THE EVENT STATES IN THE ENGINE, ITS CLEANER THAT WAY
2. CREATE A HELPER FUCNTION FOR SHORTCUTS TO INITIALIZE ANIMATION INSTANCE
    > function to set first n states to 0
    > function for manually setting values at position n
2.5 Instead of using IO_getWidth each time, have an event listener and store the state in the engine OR 
    Just store the state in the engine

3. CREATE GETTERS FOR THE STATES IN ANIMATION CLASS

REFACTOR YOUR CODE (the demarcations: make them less frequent and remove them when not needed in a  file ?)

4. Make sure to foward declare all your functions AND typedefs (follow the utils.event.h file structure)
5. Make the main file cleaner sheesh
6. Create a warning on the terminal in case the program doesnt run properly (in case conhost doesnt execute for some reason)
    > in this case, tell the user to execute main.exe with an argument or smthh
7. SET THE FONT SIZE + FONT FAMILY OF THE TERMINAL TO PREVENT HAVING A BIGGER BUFFER SIZE BECAUSE OF SMALL FONTS

also consider not using puts() on Linux? maybe its slower there or smth hm

ehmm pretend we didnt see this LMAO
