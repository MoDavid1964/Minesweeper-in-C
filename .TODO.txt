There seems to be something wrong with one of the _exit() functions; IO_exit() is never called because of crash?

add a "screenshot" feature (basically it just outputs the current text on the screen on a text file, preferably with colors tho)

LOOK FOR ALL PLACES WHERE WE INCREMENT someCount++ AFTER ADDING TO A HASHMAP OR SMTH, AND MAKE HashMap_add() return a boolean
this way, if HashMap_add fails, we dont increment someCount++

REFACTOR YOUR CODE (the demarcations: make them less frequent and remove them when not needed in a  file ?)

1. Make sure to foward declare all your functions AND typedefs (THEY SHOULD BE RIGHT AFTER THE IMPORTS BEFORE ALL OTHER CODE)
2. Make the main file cleaner sheesh
3. SET THE FONT SIZE + FONT FAMILY OF THE TERMINAL TO PREVENT HAVING A BIGGER BUFFER SIZE BECAUSE OF SMALL FONTS

ehmm pretend we didnt see this LMAO
