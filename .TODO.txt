// IMPLEMENT BUFFER CLASS

REFACTOR YOUR CODE (the demarcations: make them less frequent and remove them when not needed in a  file ?)

1. Make sure to foward declare all your functions AND typedefs (follow the utils.event.h file structure)
2. Make the main file cleaner sheesh
4. Create a warning on the terminal in case the program doesnt run properly (in case conhost doesnt execute for some reason)
    > in this case, tell the user to execute main.exe with an argument or smthh
