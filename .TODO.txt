1. Make sure to foward declare all your functions
2. Make the main file cleaner sheesh
3. Output the warnings and errors of the compilation unto the build folder (or a separate log folder ??)
4. Create a warning on the terminal in case the program doesnt run properly (in case conhost doesnt execute for some reason)
    > in this case, tell the user to execute main.exe with an argument or smthh

might it be better to have the following caller structure?

if(WaitForSingleObject(dataMutex, TIMEOUT) == WAIT_TIMEOUT)
    // ! do some stuff but dont touch resource
else {
    // ! do stuff
    // ! modify resource
    ReleaseMutex(dataMutex);
}
